# SEI-Project-4 - Know Your Mp

This is the final project I completed in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive project, a full stack application built with Django REST Framework and React. 

Deployed project:

## Overview and Timeframe
This was an 8 day project with the goal of building out a full-stack application whilst creating my own front and back end. I used Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve my data from a Postgres database. The end product needed to contain multiple relationships and CRUD functionality.
