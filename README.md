# SEI-Project-4 - Know Your Mp

This is the final project I completed in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive project, a full stack application built with Django REST Framework and React. 

Deployed project:

## Overview and Timeframe
This was an 8 day project with the goal of building out a full-stack application whilst creating my own front and back end. I used Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve my data from a Postgres database. The end product needed to contain multiple relationships and CRUD functionality. 

## Technologies Used:
Django 
Django REST Framework 
PostgreSQL
JavaScript (ES6)
React.js
HTML
CSS
Bulma
Axios
react-router-dom

## Development
I decided to base my project on the fact that the government's website is not the most user friendly and hard to navigate. I also believe there is a gap in the education system that politics needs to fill. 

I started by building out my entire back end, with my models, views and serialisers. I spent the first two days of the project ensuring the relationships were all working allowing my functionality to be seamless. Insomnia REST Client was a very useful tool at this stage of the project, allowing me to regularly check my code was running smoothly.
